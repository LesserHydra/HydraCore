#HydraCore

##Info

HydraCore serves as a sink for utility functions and NMS dependencies in my Bukkit plugins. Due to its (currently) volatile nature, it would likely be inadvisable to base your own plugins off of it. Major versions indicate breaking changes (name and/or contract changes), and minor versions indicate new features or updated dependencies.

Issues and pull requests are welcome and appreciated.
